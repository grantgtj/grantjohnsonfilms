				I’m a cinematographer of narrative films and promotional content. I absolutely love this job and everything that comes with it: the the places I go, the people I meet, and the challenges in every shoot. <br> <br>
	
				Born and raised in Los Angeles, I moved to New York City to pursue cinematography at NYU. While primarily shooting student and independent short films, I’ve also interned at Legendary Entertainment and headed production of promotional content for toy company “YoYoJam”. I love to keep my camera on me wherever I go, capturing the fleeting moments of everyday life and looking for visuals that intrigue me. <br> <br>
	
				I’m fascinated in exploring the complexities of the human experience, by telling stories that service the entire spectrum of emotions we feel. Whether it be plots of triumph, heartbreak, or even comedy, my ultimate goal is to put a spotlight on the rawness of the human condition, as well as the world we live in. I do my best to keep this in mind every time I point a light or hit the record button, and am constantly searching for new ways to make films that my viewers can relate to. <br> <br>

				This site is a collection of my cinematography work in a handful of genres and styles, as well as a space for me to share some of my favorite photographs I’ve taken on the side. Please feel free to reach out, I’m excited to work with new people who feel like they have a story worth telling.
